If the same jpeg is found in more than one place
  remember all locations

for each jpeg with more than one location
  for each location which ends with /Originals
    if there also is a same location without /Originals at the end
      delete the /Originals location

for each jpeg with more than one location
  for each nef with same name
    warn that nef is skipped, due to multiple jpeg locations
    print multiple jpeg locations
    remove nef
